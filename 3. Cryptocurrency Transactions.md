# Transactions Intuition

## Transactions and UTXOs
All transactions in bitcoin are UTXOs, i.e. Unspent Transaction Outputs.

Here, transactions lives on until another transaction is made.

In bitcoin, there is no attribute as amount.

Ledger

A->B 0.2 BTC
C->B 0.7 BTC
D->B 0.5 BTC

Now, if B want to buy an asset worth 0.6 BTC
it will happen like this

B -> asset owner 0.6 BTC
B -> B 0.6 BTC

## Where do transaction fees come from?
Fees = Total Input - Total Output

Fees is not mandatory, but everyone wants their transaction to be included as fast as possible, so we do include some fees, otherwise our transaction will not be chosen.

There is no fees variable, it's just the excess BTC amount.

## How wallets work?
Wallets just show the number for our convenience.
They actually calculate the UTXOs

## Signatures: Private and Public Key
Private key is used to generate a public key.
Whenever a transaction is done, it contains both the message and signature.
There is a verification function which used the public key to check if the signature
has also come from same private key.

## What is Segregated Witness (SegWit)?
As bitcoin got popular and more and more people started performing transactions,
it was seen that it got very slow and it also stored very less transactions.

It was noticed that, the public key and signature usually take around 60% space of the transaction
and thus it was decided to move it through a different channel separately from the block.

This resulted in faster transfer of data between peers and at the same time also allowed to
store more transactions in the block, that is why, people think size of blockchain increased.

## Public key vs Bitcoin Address
Bitcoin address is just derived from public key after doing SHA to it.

Public key is generated from private key using an elliptical function.
So even if public key is required for every transaction where we send money, it is not actually mandatory when receiving money since bitcoin address is doing that work of unique identifier.

Bitcoin is just an additional layer of security that even if someone reverse engineers the elliptical function, but he only has my bitcoin address instead of public key, so it will give some time for bitcoin community to handle the issue

## Hierarchically Deterministic (HD) Wallets
A master private key is used to generate a private key.
So using one master private key you can generate as many private keys as much you want.

There is also a master public key, which can be use to generate all the public keys.

What was the need? Basically someone can check our transactions from our address and find some pattern and may be able to find our identity.
