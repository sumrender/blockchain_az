# Cryptocurrency

In the crypto world, there are 3 layers:

1. Technology: Blockchain
2. Protocol/Coin: Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. All rules defined here
3. Token:
   Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is actually tokens.
   Tokens rely on smart contracts

## What is Bitcoin?

Created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.
Has no smart contract capabilities.
Consensus using proof of work.

## Bitcoin Monetary Policy

Everything works according to the software.
There will only every be 21 Million bitcoins and by 2140.

### The Halving

BTC/block reduces by half every 210,000 coins released.
Transaction fees are meant to replace block rewards.

### Block frequency

It is how often do those blocks that come in with the rewards

## Understanding Mining Difficulty

### What is the current target and how does that feel?

We generally use leading zeros for the problem.
For example, consider 3 digit decimal number.
It can range from 000 to 999. Now, let's add one leading zero
0XX. The new range is 000-099. Notice, the range becomes drastically shorter and reduces the probability of finding the golden nonce.

### How is "mining difficulty" calculated?

curr_target/max_target at the start of bitcoin inception.
Point to take home, is that it is very hard, in the range of trillions and even more.

## Mining Pools

distt. work at the same time preventing double work, otherwise there will be no use.
miners are paid based on the hashing power provided by the node.

## Nonce Range

Nonce is a 32 bit unsigned number.
Its range is 0 to 4 billion.

So effectively, there will be cases when even if we iterate through all the nonce range, we won't get our golden nonce, since the range of hash is much much greater than that of
nonce.

modest miner example: can go through entire nonce range in around 40 seconds. So how are we tackling this problem.

We add another property to the block, that is "timestamp".
So for every timestamp, we have 0-4 billion range of nonces that may have the solution.

So big mining orgs will still be able to handle this much computations but how do mining pools tackle this problem?

## How miners pick transactions?
Let's discuss another side of the story. Large corporations have so much computational power, that they can easily check through more than 4 billion cryptographic puzzles. 

So, then what can they do when they have idle CPU power and the timestamp has yet to change.

What they do is they try to change the data and run through the nonces again hoping the hash might be valid. So, how do they change the data?

They do this by selecting the transactions that they are storing on the block. If for one combination, they do not find the golden nonce, they can just try another combination.

A block can store 1MB or around 2000 transactions.

## CPUs vs GPUs vs ASICs

CPU, General, < 10 MH/s
GPU, Specialized, < 1 GH/s
ASIC, Totally specialized, > 1,000 GH/s

## How do Mempools work?
Mempool is a staging area for transactions.
Each node has its own mempool

## Orphaned blocks
The one with the longest chain wins.
It is what it is bro, shrugs.

## The 51% Attack
We are talking about 51% hashrate.

51% hashrate group chain holdssss

Ex: In a new cryptocurrency, using double spending loophole to
buy lot of assets and then the transactions which go back to the mempool, are not picked by the 51% group.

## Deriving the current target
Difficulty = current target / max target

Bruhhhh, kuch to kiya hai
