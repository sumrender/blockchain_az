## What is Ethereum?
A cryptocurrency, but at the same time a distributed ledger.

Goal is to become a large decentralised supercomputer on which applications can be built.

## What is smart contract?
A program that runs on blockchain.

### Concept of Turing Complete?
Turing Complete => You can write any logic on the code.

Bitcoin Script is not turing complete, it is intentional (does not have loops.)
Solidity is turing complete.

### Each node has:
1. History of all smart contracts
2. History of all transactions
3. Current state of all smart contracts

## dApps
API or interface to interact with the smart contract.

## EVM and Gas

### Security Threats
1. Virus being passed through a smart contract
2. Infinite loops

All code runs in an EVM, so the virus won't affect our system.
The infinite loops problem will not occur because each operation in a smart contract costs some gas.

Why gas instead of eth?
Gas is more precise.


## Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
Example: Self-Driving car company

## The DAO attack
- Investor-directed venture capital fund
- stateless
- hacked, then hardfork was done
- Ethereum split into ETH and ETC

## Soft and hard forks

Hard forks example:
Etherium and Etherium classic
Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin gold

Soft Fork - it is backward compatible
SegWit

## Initial Coin Offerings (ICO)
ICO can happen on either the protocol/coin or with tokens also.

IPO: founders give some profit and control
ICO: founders give some benefits? but no control is passed to the buyers.

## ICO case study
Example amusement park funding through tokens


## Blockchain startups: white papers
examples of companies with their white papers

## What is web 3.0?
