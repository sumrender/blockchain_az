## Intro

In the crypto world, there are 3 layers:

1. Technology: Blockchain
2. Protocol/Coin: Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. All rules defined here
3. Token:
   Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is actually tokens.
   Tokens rely on smart contracts

In this, we will be covering basics of layer 1, the blockchain.

### Block

A block contains of
data
prev hash
hash: which is hash of data + prev hash

### Genesis block

first block of blockchain which has no prev hash

## Understanding SHA256 Hash

Secure Hash Algorithm
takes 256 bits
64 characters long, each character takes 4 bits

### Requirements of hash algorithms:

1. One Way
2. Deterministic
3. Fast computation
4. Avalanche effect
5. Must withstand collisions

## Immutable Ledger

If any change is made, then the cryptographic link gets broken.
example: house deeds, diamonds

## Distributed P2P network

If there is only 1 server running the chain, and someone puts in the effort to change a block, and then update the prev hash of all the blocks ahead, what's stopping them?
If a user by mistakes edits a block, how to restore data?

every transaction is checked across the p2p network,
and if a chain divurges, it is automatically corrected by other chains based on consensus

## How mining works

In a block, the block number, data and previous hash is constant.
To be able to change the hash of the block, we use another
variable: the nonce.
It is used to change value of hash, and by changing the nonce, the miners try to reach a hash which is less than target and be able to mine the block.
Miners all have to brute force the thing.
Goal is to reach the golden nonce...

How is a transaction is stored on a block??

## Byzantine Fault Tolerance

We need systems or our blockchain to be fault tolerant.
Example of 4 generals attacking or retreating and all can relay messages to each other. As long as the number of traitors is less than 33% the system will be fault tolerant.

## Consensus Protocol

### Challenges:

    1. Adding a malicious new block
    2. Competing chains, 2 chains mined block at the same time

    Whenever a miner adds a block to the blockchain, he is awarded some coins, and he also gets paid the fees from storing all the transactions on that block. Before a block is added to the chain, it is passed through various checks like (Merkle Hash???), prev hash etc. and if the checks fail, then the block is rejected and the miner is penalized. So, very rarely will a miner ever add a malicious block

    For competing chains, ultimately the longer chain wins, and the loser block is called orphan block and unfortunately becomes invalid, that is why people generally wait for 2-3 blocks to be mined before moving ahead.
    So, it all boils down to the 51% side with more hashing power will ultimately decide the chain
